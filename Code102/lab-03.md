Revisions and the Cloud

Learning Git reminds me a lot of Dr Suess. >Oh The Places We Go
Endless options and flexability. It is all so strange, odd and facinating.
Like;

Cloning: copies all versions of all files for a project. To clone a repository into a directory with another name of your choosing, use the following command format:
$ git clone https://github.com/test mydirectory

Git Status: A common function to check the status of a file
$ git status

Git Add: This information tells us that there are changes to be committed and that the file has been staged.
$ git add * or git add .

Git Commit: *This step has committed changes for the file or files (you can have one commit message for multiple files, if applicable) to the HEAD.
$ git commit -m 'MESSAGE OF CHANGES'

Git Push: This command pushes changes from the local “master” branch to the remote repository named “origin”.
$ git push
