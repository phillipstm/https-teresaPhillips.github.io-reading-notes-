## Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an internal format that a runtime environment can actually run, for example the JavaScript engine inside browsers.

### HTML parsing
HTML parces data into a DOM * Document Object Model. HTML parsing involves tokenization and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values.
### CSS parsing
It parses the text into the CSS Object Model (or CSSOM), a data structure it then uses for styling layouts and painting. The browser then creates a render tree from both these structures to be able to paint the content to the screen. JavaScript is also downloaded, parsed, and then executed.
### JS parsing
JavaScript parsing is done during compile time or whenever the parser is invoked, such as during a call to a method.
