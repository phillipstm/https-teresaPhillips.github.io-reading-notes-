## AWS Lambda Basics

What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.

individual tasks run for a short time;
each task is generally self-contained;
there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application.

Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

The concept of “serverless” computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions.

It doesn’t mean that there are no servers involved: it just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code.

## CDN-Content Delivery Network

<https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/>

What is a CDN?

A geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site’s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content. CDNs will also communicate with the originating server to deliver any content that has not been previously cached. In turn, the speed is improved by distributing content closer to the website visitors by using a nearby CDN server, causing visitors to experience faster page loading times.

What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

The main reasons why company want to use CDNs are to improve Internet website load speeds, content delivery speeds, and to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to and improve defenses against Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS).
